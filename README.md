hello
I think i figured something out :)
I tested somethings in an alt repo and when i put in a racket file, it recognized the language.
I'm assuming github doesnt recognize danmakufu, but im not entirely sure if thats a bad thing or not 

Ha, nothing's gonna recognize Danmakufu, it's way too niche. It's fine, we don't need it to.
Why is this in the readme?
